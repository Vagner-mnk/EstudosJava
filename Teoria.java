 Algorithms Dykstras  star 
 
 Trees. traversal and manipulation algorithms, hash tables, stocks, arrays, linked lists, recursion, 
 
 binary search - To do binary search, your elements must be sorted
 
 DIfference between arrays, list and hash tables
 arrays - their size is fixed 
		- store data contiguosly
		- you must to specify an array size when you declare the array  because the operating system has to reserve the appopriate amount of memory, that is no garantee that more memory will be available adjacent to your array will be available for use later, so arrays cannot easily grow  
linked lists - elements are not contiguos in memory
           	 - can grow easily
			 -Each node contains the element that we want to store, as well as a pointer to the subsequent element in the list
			 -have no random access to the elements, in order to access a certain element, it is necessary to traverse the entire list until the desired element is reached
			 
			 (A linked list is nothing but a collection of nodes, where each node contains a value and pointer to the next node in the list

HashTables - are used when speedy of insertion, deletion and lookup are priority
